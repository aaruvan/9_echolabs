Week of Feb 6, 2026
- Set up split settings with dev/prod configuration and .env usage.
- Added four required views for Conversation model.
- Created templates with base layout and list/empty state.

View mapping for grading:
- HttpResponse FBV: conversations_manual_view (raw HTML response)
- render() FBV: conversations_render_view (renders conversation list template)
- Base CBV: ConversationsBaseView (renders conversation list template)
- Generic CBV: ConversationsListView (ListView for Conversation)

Reflections (optional):
- HttpResponse vs render: raw HTML is quick for demos, render is cleaner for templates.
- Base CBV vs Generic CBV: Base is explicit, Generic saves boilerplate for lists.

Notes/reminders:
- Capture screenshots for all four view URLs.
- Capture empty-state and normal list states.
