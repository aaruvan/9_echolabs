Week of Feb 6, 2026
- Set up split settings with dev/prod configuration and .env usage.
- Added four required views for Conversation model.
- Created templates with base layout and list/empty state.

View mapping for grading:
- HttpResponse FBV: conversations_manual_view (raw HTML response)
- render() FBV: conversations_render_view (renders conversation list template)
- Base CBV: ConversationsBaseView (renders conversation list template)
- Generic CBV: ConversationsListView (ListView for Conversation)

Reflections (optional):
- HttpResponse vs render: raw HTML is quick for demos, render is cleaner for templates.
- Base CBV vs Generic CBV: Base is explicit, Generic saves boilerplate for lists.

Notes/reminders:
- Capture screenshots for all four view URLs.
- Capture empty-state and normal list states.

Week of Feb 6, 2026 (A3)
- get_absolute_url: Conversation model uses get_absolute_url for detail links.
- Static files: CSS is stored in project-level static/css and loaded in base.html.
- Cache busting (optional): append a version query string like `styles.css?v=1` if needed.
- API plan: Provide conversation list data (id, title, recorded_at, duration) via JSON.
